# Real-Time Location Tracking

This project allows real-time location tracking of devices using **Node.js**, **Socket.io**, and **Leaflet.js** for the frontend map display. The application uses geolocation to track and share the user's location in real-time, allowing multiple devices to be tracked simultaneously.

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Track the location of devices in real-time on a map.
- **Leaflet.js Map**: Use Leaflet.js for displaying location on an interactive map.
- **Socket.io Communication**: Devices communicate in real-time to send and receive location updates.
- **Geolocation API**: Uses the browser’s geolocation API to get the user's location.

## Advantages
- **Live Location Sharing**: Users can share their real-time location with others, providing better coordination for activities like deliveries, ride-sharing, and event tracking.
- **Scalable**: The app allows multiple devices to track each other’s location in real-time, making it scalable for use cases with many users.
- **Cross-platform**: Works across desktop and mobile browsers, making it accessible on different platforms.
- **Interactive Map**: Provides a clear and interactive interface for visualizing the location data, improving the user experience.
- **Socket.io for Real-Time Communication**: Enables instant updates without requiring users to refresh the page.
